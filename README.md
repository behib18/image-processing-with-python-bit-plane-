# image-processing-with-python-bit-plane-

This is an image processing project( bit plane ), which is programmed by Python.
In order to display the bit planes of an image, the image should be transformed to gray scale. So, the first step is to be sure that the image entered is in gray scale shape. 
Then, Pixels information is stored to an array. In fact, that information will be transformed to binary numbers with the length of 8. The reason is that bit plane images are made of
"Bit".
In order to access to every bit plane image, we should have a matrix, which is made of the bit of image. The matrix is made of 8 bits and every image can be gained by the number of
index in that matrix. In addition, the output will be saved in jpg format.
